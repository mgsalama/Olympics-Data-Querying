# Olympics Data Querying
A short personal project working with SQL queries to explore data about summer olympics.

Main dataset regarding Summer Olympics medals and athletes from 1976 - 2008 taken from Kaggle user Divyansh Agrawal. Original dataset can be found [here!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals)

Second CSV regarding information on cities, their countries and continents created by me, simply to showcase a basic JOIN for this project.

Note: Importing of CSVs was done within MySQLWorkbench.
